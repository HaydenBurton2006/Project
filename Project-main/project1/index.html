        <p>Minions debuted in London on June 11, 2015, and was released in the United States on July 10. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the animation, voice acting, and score, but criticized the character development and humor, which some called unfunny and inappropriate. Coffin has also expressed displeasure in the final film. The film grossed $1.159 billion worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as fifth-highest-grossing film of 2015 and the second-highest-grossing animated film of all time. It also became the highest-grossing film produced by Illumination until it was surpassed by The Super Mario Bros. Movie in 2023. 
            The success of Minions spawned a sequel: Minions: The Rise of Gru (2022) with another sequel planned for 2026.
